# Example Post by a student in need of help:

The student also included a part of their code:

# TA response:

"Make sure that incrementing index counters for a list only happens once a value from the list that index counter is for has been added to the 
merged list."

# What the student got from that advice:

"By double checking my index increments I realized that I was incrementing index2 without first adding in the element at index2, adding this into my merged list solved all of my issues and got rid of the bug of a duplicate value being skipped over"

"This is what my tests return with this modification"

# All extra info about the scenario:

Here is the tests that were run on the merge method:

This is the original java file with a failing merge method:

Here is the contents of grade.sh:

This is the changed merge method, which now functions as intended:

I should note that all of this was sourced from the skill demo, the only change was the updates to the tests to make them accurate and to the merge method to get it to pass the tests.
